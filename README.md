# DermaCare Website

DermaCare Website is an AI-based full-stack website that aims to diagnose and treat human skin diseases. The website is built using four AI models that work together to provide a comprehensive skin disease detection and diagnosis system.

## AI Models

### Skin Disease Detection Model

The first AI model in DermaCare Website is a skin disease detection model that uses image recognition to detect whether a person, taking a photo using our online camera or uploading an image, has a skin disease or not. If the model detects a skin disease, it triggers the second AI model.

### Classification Model

The second AI model is a classification model that tries to classify a skin disease from the 10 most common skin disease categories. This model provides an accurate and reliable diagnosis, which is important for effective treatment.

### Severity Checker Model

The third AI model is a severity checker model that checks whether a skin disease is severe or not. If it is severe, our system allows the person to make an online appointment with a recommended dermatologist. This helps patients get the right treatment at the right time.

### Customer Service Chatbot Model

The fourth AI model is a customer service chatbot model that provides service to customers. This model helps customers get answers to their questions quickly and easily, without the need for human intervention.
